- create a csv file of all test products 
- run a one off job to add these products to the database

- integrate openAI setup
- create an endpoint that takes a product name and return the product if it exists or ask the user if it can make a suggestion of similar products
- if the user agree to suggest similar products, use openAI to generate a list of similar products and return them
otherwise just return


- when a user says 'I want a tv'
- how will AI know the product from the user's statement ?

SOLUTION APPROACH
-send the user's prompt to chatGPT to list all the products from the user's intent e.g ['Television', 'radio']
-return all the products that matches the AI response []

CHALLEENGES
-How does AI understand user's intent and reply accurately ?

TODO: 
- test the AI setup
- create the endpoint for user to interrct with the AI, takes user input, reprocess the AI response<find products in the category from the AI response> and return the result
- Create a README file, describing the project
- publish to render
- create a dockerfile
- create a docker-compose file
- deploy to AWS
- test the app with load testing
- create a CICD pipeline
